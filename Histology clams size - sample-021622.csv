Ruditapes philippinarum,M1,41,58,,F ,"follicles are visible, I believe this is an early active female but it is difficult to distinguish from inactive of either sex "
,M2,31,49,,M,exhibitng both early and late active stage - mature spermatozoa present
,M3,35,49,,unknown ,hard to find/determine if there is gonad tissue. likely inactive 
,M4,37,52,,F,early active 
,M5,36,51,,NA,inactive I believe 
,M6,40,53,,F,couldn't distinguis follicles but spotted some developing oocytes...
,M7,43,56,,M,very early active male
,M8,35,50,,F,"follicles beginning to develop, found just a couple developing oocytes"
,M9,40,56,,M,very early active 
,M10,43,55,,M,very early active - only a small amount of spermatazoa
,M11,27,38,,F,early active - very little gonad tissue present 
,M12,38,49,,F,early active
,M13,35,47,,M,early active
,M14,37,48,,F,early active
,M15,37,51,,F,early active
,M16,41,54,creamy,M,"I would call this one ripe! If not, it is very very close to being ripe (the microscope only goes to 40x so it is difficult to determine whether some of the sperm are mature)"
,M17,37,49,,NA,inactive - did not see any developing oogonia or sperm 
,M18,45,59,creamy,M,early active stage male (low density of mature spermatozoa and plenty of connective tissue present)
,M19,34,50,,M,"early active, only one little area shows developing sperm and the rest looks inactive "
Leukoma staminea,L1,34,42,,F,"follicles are developing, very early active female - can see developing oogonia "
,L2,45,54,,F,very early active female - observed oogonia
,L3,29,38,,M,"I would consider this one inactive, I could tell it was male due to the presence of maybe a dozen spermatozoa throughout the entire gonad region but it was nowhere near being considered early active... "
,L4,42,49,,M,early active 
,L5,33,38,,,follicles visible but can not distinguish sex
,L6,41,50,,NA,inactive
,L7,42,50,,M,very early active male
,L8,32,36,,F,follicles still developing - can see several developing oogonia 
,L9,45,53,,F,very early active female - follicles visible and some developing oogonia
,L10,34,38,,F,super early active female - spotted 2 or 3 developing oogonia but closer to inactive
,L11,36,45,,F,"I believe this is early active female, but I will need to double check another day"
,L12,33,40,may have been a mix up L12/L13,NA,could not distinguish sex 
,L13,34,41,,F,"follicles present, few developing oocytes "
,L14,42,52,,F,"early active, a few mature oocytes "
,L15,35,42,,F," very early active, can see a few developing oogonia "
,L16,37,45,,M,early active
,L17,41,50,,F,very early active
,L18,34,41,,F,"spent? couple mature oocytes, follicles appear empty"
,L19,36,42,,F,super early active
,L20,35,42,,F,early active - follicles visible/developing
